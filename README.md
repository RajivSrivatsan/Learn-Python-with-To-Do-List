# Learn-Python-with-To-Do-List
This repository will help you be strong with python basics as we will learn python by actually doing it in real-time.

There are different types of program categories
1. Interactive Programs and 2. Non-interactive programs

The Interactive program is sub - divided into 3 more categories:
- Command Line interface
- Desktop Graphical User interface
- Web interface(Web apps)

Examples of Non - Interactive programs:

Runs as background processes and does not interact with users.

- Deleting browsing history
- Scheduled run of mails etc...

We will build a to-do list app, and then add GUI and a Web app for the same.
